<h1>Mapping Police Shootings</h1>
<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>Web development skills don't just allow you to create slick web pages -- they enable you to communicate important information to broad audiences.  In this exercise, you'll create an interactive map of the crowdsourced police shootings <a href="http://regressing.deadspin.com/deadspin-police-shooting-database-update-were-still-go-1627414202" target="_blank">data</a>  from deadspin.</p>

<p></p>

<h2>Objectives</h2>
<p>By completing this challenge, you will practice and demonstrate mastery of the following skills:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Cloning a GitHub repository</li>
    <li>Requesting data using an AJAX call</li>
    <li>Creating an interactive map using Leaflet.js</li>
    <li>Deploy a web site to a web server using git</li>
</ul>

<h2>Resources</h2>

<p>We'll have a lecture that introduces the skills described above, and those should be used as a springboard to build a creative interactive visualization using the data provided.</p>

<h3>Relevant Slides from Class</h3>

<h3>Resources on the Web</h3>

</ul>

<h2>Required Features</h2>

<p>This challenge begins by providing you with step by step instructions. This should get you started, but the core of this challenge is about designing an interactive map that creatively and movingly presents the data provided.  The steps will help you get set up, but then its up to you to design the interactivity of your map.  If you have any questions about ideas, <a ng-href="mailto:kshino@uw.edu"> ask your TA,</a> or <a href="mailto:mikefree@uw.edu">ask Mike</a>.</p>

<h3>Fork and Clone the Repo</h3>

<p>You should now be comfortable forking and cloning a repository usig Gitub. This starting repository contains file stubs and the various assets you will need to complete the challenge.</p>

<ol class="steps">
    <li>Go to my <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/mkfreeman/police-shooting">Police Shooting Repo</a> on GitHub</li>
    <li>Click the "Fork" button located to the right of the repository name and follow any instructions you might receive<br/> 
        <img class="img-responsive screenshot" src="img/screenshots/police-shooting/fork-button.png" alt="fork button on GitHub">
    </li>
    <li>In <strong>your forked repository on GitHub</strong> (not my original one), click the copy button next to the HTTPS clone URL to copy that URL to your clipboard <br>
        <img class="img-responsive screenshot" src="img/screenshots/html-css/copy-clone-url.png" alt="copy clone url screenshot">
    </li>
    <li>Clone the repository to your local machine, just like you've done before.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Building your map</h3>

<p>Your <code>index.html</code> file already has all of the necessary libraries and files included for you to begin building your map.  However, it does not actually call the function that will build your map.  Inside of the <code>&ltscript&gt</code> tag of your <code>index.html</code> file, call the function that draws your map (<code>drawMap</code>).</p>

<p class="alert alert-warning">Note, the <code>drawMap</code> function must be called after the <code>&ltdiv id="container"&gt</code> element is created in your<code>index.html</code> file.  This is because the function depends on the existence of a container <code>&ltdiv&gt</code> element.  Alternatively, in your <code>drawMap</code> function, you could first append a container <code>&ltdiv&gt</code> to build your map in, and reference that id.</p>

<p>In your <code>map.js</code> file, there are three empty functions already waiting for you.  In the first function, <code>drawMap</code>, you should follow the code pattern demonstrated in class to build a map using Leaflet.js.  Feel free to use the same maptiles we used in class (<a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/" target="_blank">OpenStreetMap</a>), or seek out some different styles from another map tile provider such as <a href="https://www.mapbox.com/developers/" target="_blank">mapbox</a>.  Once you've completed this step, your maptiles should appear within the container div on your page.</p>

<p>In the second function, <code>getData</code>, you should write an AJAX request that gets data from the file <code>data/response.json</code>.  This file contains an array of objects, one for each shooting incident.  When the AJAX request is successful, you should call the third function, <code>customBuild</code>. 
</p>

<p class="alert alert-warning">Note, the <code>customBuild</code> function must be called inside the data request, only once the AJAX call has completed successfully.  This is because of the asynchronous nature of the request (i.e., your JavaScript code would keep running before the data was returned if you just wrote it in line).</p>


<h3>Do something creative</h3>

<p>Simply building the map and showing locations of police shootings with hover text is a good start to this challenge, though we cover all of those skills in class.  Now is your chance to manipulate the map in novel ways to showcase a particular story in the data.  There are lots of powerful ways to introduce and display the data in this dataset.  First, think about the number of different dimensions of the data you have to work with:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Date of the incident ('Date Searched')</li>
    <li>Summary of the incident ('Summary')</li>
    <li>Link to a new story ('Source Link')</li>
    <li>If the person shot was killed ('Hit or killed?')</li>
    <li>The race of the person shot ('Race')</li>
    <li>Many more, just look at the properties of the data...</li>
</ul>

While this is not a data visualization course, you can easily imagine the different ways in which you may want to show different variables of interest.  Here are some ideas to get you started:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Changing the color or opacity of each marker based on race</li>
    <li>Adding different <a href="http://leafletjs.com/examples/layers-control.html" target="_blank">layers</a> to your map, based on race, outcome, or year.</li>
    <li>Animating the display of each marker (i.e., bring them in one at a time, or by month -- this could be tricky...)</li>
    <li>Changing the size of each marker based on the age of the person</li>
</ul>


<h3>Additional information</h3>

<p>Showcasing sensitive data requires that you properly introduce the topic and site your sources.  In addition to creating your map, your submitted webpage should include the following:
    <ul>
        <li>A description of what the map is showing</li>
        <li>A link to the original data source</li>
        <li>Any other information that you belive helps contextualize your project</li>
    </ul>
</p>
