<h1 class="challenge-title">Teaching Presentation</h1>
<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>For the first 2 weeks of class, you've been led through interactive lectures about how to use different JavaScript libraries and packages -- now it's your turn to do the teaching.  To truly master a topic, you must be able to both implement it, and explain it to others.  In this challenge, you'll identify a JavaScript library of your choice, and give a 30 minute presentation on it, including an interactive exercise.</p>

<p>There are tons of open source JavaScript libraries out there to make your life easier -- everything from <a href="http://mynameismatthieu.com/WOW/" target="_blank">silly scrolling</a> to <a href="http://t4t5.github.io/sweetalert/" target="_blank">better alert messages</a>.  Find one that you like, and share it with the class!</p>


<h2>Objectives</h2>

<p>By completing this challenge, you will practice and demonstrate mastery of the following skills:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Identify and teach yourself a new JavaScript library</li>
    <li>Develop teaching materials for explaining a topic</li>
    <li>Evaluate the limitations of a library</li>
    <li>Code up an exercise that both highlights the functionality of a library, and teaches it</li>
</ul>

<h2>Resources</h2>

<p>This challenge is really about going out there and finding a library that <strong>you</strong> find interesting/fun/useful.  Try and find a solution that someone else has made to a problem you've encountered, or build a creative application using the tools that you find!</p>

</ul>

<h2>Required Features</h2>

<p>Depending on the specifics of the library you choose, your presentation may take on different formats.  Make sure to pick a moderately sophisticated library or package that is actually worth learning for you and others.  Regardless of the platform you use, you must cover the following information</p>
<ul>
    <li>How did you find the library you're using?</li>
    <li>What does the package do (i.e., why would you use it)?</li>
    <li>Explain the syntax of the package (i.e., how does it work)?</li>
    <li>What challenges did you encounter in using the package, and/or why would you <strong>not</strong> use it?</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to communicating the information above to your fellow classmates, you must include an interactive exercise that allows students to explore the implementation of the package.  Feel free to use the approach in class (<a href="http://jsbin.com" target="_blank">jsBin</a>), or another method, such as coding together, or providing a coding challenge.  This exercise should demonstrate how to use the package, and in doing so, highlight its functionality</p>

<p>You may choose to divide your time (30 minutes) as you see fit.  If you believe more explanation is needed, spend more time on describing how the package works.  If you would rather create a fun exercise for your classmates, allocate more time to the interactive component of your assignment.</p>

<p>All group members must participate in presenting the material to the classroom, as well as in the preparation of the materials.  If there are any concerns with the distribution of work, try to work it out with your fellow group members, or involve Mike or you TA if necessary.</p>
