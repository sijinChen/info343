section,contentoverview,"Welcome to client-side web development!  This course will cover the skills and techniques necessary for creating effective, dynamic, and responsive web applications that meet user needs.  Through a variety of challenges, students will learn best practices for developing mobile-friendly web pages.  Individual and group assignments will not only help develop skills, but will help students create a portfolio of their work.  Upon completing this course, students will be able to build robust web applications, and will have the foundation for independently learning new web development skills."dates,6/23/2015 - 7/22/2015time,"M/T/W/Th, 4:15 - 7:20"location,MGH 430credits,5instructor,Michael Freemaninstructor_position,"Lecturer, Information School"instructor_email,mikefree@uw.eduta,Kristen Shinoharata_position,"PhD Candidate, Information School"ta_email,kshino@uw.educlass_time,"Class time is designed to be a fun and interactive time for students to engage with both the material and one another.  We will follow a mixed lecture/exercise format that allows students to experiment with techniques as they are introduced in a lecture.  It is an expectation that students are actively engaged in these activities, and assist their classmates when appropriate. "challenges,"Because of the ever-changing nature of web development, the purpose of this course is for students to learn how to teach themselves new tools (rather than learn a pre-defined set of skills).  To accomplish this, students are expected to complete a series of challenges that assess their progress throughout the course.  Lectures provide the necessary background information that enables students to seek out solutions for challenges.  The first set of challenges ensures that students cover a core set of competencies.  These are very detailed and structred assignments, designed to practice fundamental web development skills.  Once these core skills are strong, challenges become much less structured.  The latter half of class is designed to facilitate the exploration of new technologies, and apply them to projects of interest.  Through a self-directed group project and teaching your fellow students advanced topics of your choice, students have the freedom to explore the elements of web development that they find most intruiging.  "grading,"Students earn points by completing challenges thoroughly and on time.  While the first set of challenges is rather straightforward, students will need to stretch their technical skills and creativity to receive full credit on the last 4 challenges.  The maximum number of points a student can earn on any challenge will decrease by 10% each day after the deadline.  This is to encourage the timely completion of assignments in a condensed quarter.  If you have extenuating circumstances and cannot complete an assignment on time, please let us know in advance. Peer reviews of work on the group project will also contribute to your final grade.  "open_source,"One of the best things about client-side web development is that it's (largely) open source.  During this course, you will both learn from and contribute to the open source community.  In cases that you use code that you did not write, you must include a reference to where you found the code (a URL is fine).  For example, there are lots of code skeletons for creating interactive visualizations on the web.  It's fine to use these, just be honest about it.  For independent assignments, feel free to work with your fellow students to think through challenging tasks.  However, each students' assignment should be significantly different from that of other students.  If there is any suspicion of plagerism, there will be notable consequences both for within the context of this course and in the University at large.  If you have any questions about the appropriateness of using open source code or working together, don't hesitate to ask.  "
